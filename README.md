# Work in progress
# Wiki Football Data

# Goal

To create a web platform accessible to all to share analytical football data which are processed by users through the [soccerLogger](https://github.com/playerank/soccerLogger)<br/> application.

# Description

In this platform matches are divided into time slot so users can coopearate and split the work.
Once the analysis of a time slot is completed it will be posted to let other users see it and judge it, since the subjective nature of some evaluations,if the analysis reaches a certain number of negative ratings then it will be possible to remove it and to post a new one, otherwise the same number of positive ratings makes the analysis "confirmed".
Once a match is entirely analyzed and the results "confirmed", the data created by registered users will be visible even by unregistered users.
